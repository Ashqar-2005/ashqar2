          In his early life, Mehta did jobs, often related to sales, including
          selling hosiery, cement, and sorting diamonds. Mehta started his
          career as a salesperson in the Mumbai office of New India Assurance
          Company Limited (NIACL). During this time, he got interested in the
          stock market and after a few days, resigned and joined a brokerage
          firm. In the early 1980s, he moved to a lower-level clerical job at
          the brokerage firm Harjivandas Nemidas Securities where he worked a
          jobber for the broker Prasann Pranjivandas Broker who he considered
          his "Guru". Over a period of ten years, beginning 1980, he served in
          positions of increasing responsibility at a series of brokerage firms.
          By 1990, he had risen to a position of prominence in the Indian
          securities industry, with the media (including popular magazines such
          as Business Today) touting him as "Amitabh Bachchan of the Stock
          market".[6] Mehta founded Grow More Research and Asset Management,
          with the financial assistance of associates, when the BSE auctioned a
          broker's card [6] and actively started to trade in 1986.[6] By early
          1990, a number of eminent people began to invest in his firm and
          utilize his services. It was at this time that he began trading
          heavily in the shares of Associated Cement Company (ACC). The price of
          shares in the cement company eventually rose from ₹200 to nearly
          ₹9,000 due to a massive spate of buying from a set of brokers
          including Mehta.[12] Mehta justified this excessive trading in ACC
          shares by stating that the stock had been undervalued, and that the
          market had simply corrected when it revalued the company at a price
          equivalent to the cost of building a similar enterprise; the so-called
          "replacement cost theory" that he had put forward.[13] During this
          period, especially in 1990–1991, the media portrayed a heightened
          deified image of Mehta, calling him "The Big Bull". He was covered in
          a cover page article of a number of publications including the popular
          economic magazine Business Today, in an article titled "Raging Bull".
          His flashy lifestyle of a sea facing 15,000 square feet penthouse in
          the tony area of Worli complete with a mini golf course and swimming
          pool, and his fleet of cars including a Toyota Corolla, Lexus LS400,
          and Toyota Sera were flashed in publications. These further
          exemplified his image at a time when these were rarities even for the
          rich people of India.[14] In criminal indictments later brought by the
          authorities, it was alleged that Mehta and his associates then
          undertook a much broader scheme, which resulted in manipulating the
          rise in the Bombay Stock Exchange. The scheme was financed by
          supposedly collateralised bank receipts, which were in fact
          uncollateralised. The bank receipts were used in short-term
          bank-to-bank lending, known as "ready forward" transactions, which
          Mehta's firm brokered. By the second half of 1991 Mehta had earned the
          nickname of the "Big Bull", because he was said to have started the
          bull run in the stock market.[13] Some of the people who worked in his
          firm included Ketan Parekh, who later would be involved in his own
          replicate scam.[11] Background of the 1992 security fraud Bank funds
          scam Up to the early 90's banks in India were not allowed to invest in
          the equity markets. However, they were expected to post profits and to
          retain a certain ratio (threshold) of their assets in government fixed
          interest bonds. Mehta cleverly squeezed capital out of the banking
          system to address this requirement of banks and pumped this money into
          the share market. He also promised the banks higher rates of interest,
          while asking them to transfer the money into his personal account,
          under the guise of buying securities for them from other banks. At
          that time, a bank had to go through a broker to buy securities and
          forward bonds from other banks. Mehta used this money temporarily in
          his account to buy shares, thus hiking up demand of certain shares (of
          good established companies like ACC, Sterlite Industries and Videocon)
          dramatically, selling them off, passing on a part of the proceeds to
          the bank and kept the rest for himself. This resulted in stocks like
          ACC (which was trading in 1991 for ₹200/share) skyrocketing to nearly
          ₹9,000 in just 3 months.[11] Bank receipt fraud Another instrument
          used in a big way was the bank receipt. In a ready forward deal,
          securities were not moved back and forth in actuality. Instead, the
          borrower, i.e. the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the
          securities a BR. The BR serves as a receipt from the selling bank, and
          also promises that the buyer will receive the securities they have
          paid for at the end of the terms. Having figured this out, Mehta
          needed banks, which could issue fake BRs, or BRs not backed by any
          government securities. Once these fake BRs were issued, they were
          passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave money to Mehta,
          plainly assuming that they were lending against government securities
          when this was not really the case.[15] He took the price of ACC from
          ₹200 to ₹9,000 (an increase of 4,400%). Since he had to book profits
          in the end, the day he sold was the day when the markets
          crashed.[16][17] Outbreak of 1992 securities fraud On 23 April 1992,
          journalist Sucheta Dalal exposed illegal methods in a column in The
          Times of India. Mehta was dipping illegally into the banking system to
          finance his buying. A typical ready forward deal involved two banks
          brought together by a broker in lieu of a commission. The broker
          handles neither the cash nor the securities, though that was not the
          case in the lead-up to the fraud. In this settlement process,
          deliveries of securities and payments were made through the broker.
          That is, the seller handed over the securities to the broker, who
          passed them to the buyer, while the buyer gave the cheque to the
          broker, who then made the payment to the seller. In this settlement
          process, the buyer and the seller might not even know with whom they
          had traded, either being known only to the broker. This the brokers
          could manage primarily because by now they had become market makers
          and had started trading on their account. To keep up a semblance of
          legality, they pretended to be undertaking the transactions on behalf
          of a bank. Mehta used forged BRs to gain unsecured loans, and used
          several small banks to issue BRs on demand. Once these fake BRs were
          issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave
          money to Mehta, mistakenly believing that they were lending against
          government securities. This money was used to drive up the prices of
          stocks in the stock market. When time came to return the money, the
          shares were sold for a profit and the BR was retired. The money due to
          the bank was returned. This went on as long as the stock prices rose,
          and no one knew about Mehta's operations. Once the fraud was exposed,
          though, many banks were left holding worthless BRs – the banking
          system had been swindled out of a whopping ₹40 billion (equivalent to
          ₹310 billion or US$3.6 billion in 2023). They knew that they would be
          accused if people discovered his involvement in issuing cheques to
          Mehta. Subsequently, it transpired that Citibank, brokers like Pallav
          Sheth and Ajay Kayan, industrialists like Aditya Birla, Hemendra
          Kothari, a number of politicians, and the RBI Governor
          S.Venkitaramanan all had allowed or facilitated Mehta's market
          manipulation.[18]
